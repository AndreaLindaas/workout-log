## Problem

People are not excercising enough and the national health average is declining. To solve this we can create an applicaton to help motivate and engange the user to excercise more. Providing a workout log to track your progress may give the user an incentive to continue excercising.

## Solution

The application has a simple design, built mobile first because the users will be using it while exercising. It is of course possible to register exercises (or performances as they are called in the application) later aswell.

This app is an MVP, so there will be both missing and least effort functionality in some areas. Nevertheless, the application is working and you can register a user and begin your travel towards better health using this excercise tracker.
